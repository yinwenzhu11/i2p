### 1. Who collected the data?

The data set was collected by Murray Cox from Airbnb’s website which contains useful information of Airbnb business listings technically, and it is provided on the Inside Airbnb.

---

### 2. Why did they collect it?

There are contradictions between the two datasets released by Airbnb in December 2015, which appear to have misled the public. Therefore, Murray's aim in collecting the data was to quantify the impact of short-term rentals on dwellings and residence communities, which might help policymakers better address the issue[1].

---

### 3. How was it collected?

These datasets were created by combining publicly accessible information from the Airbnb website programmatically. There were two main steps of the data collection. The first step was to visit the Airbnb website search pages to locate as many listings as possible in Cities to obtain enough complete data of these listings. Secondly, because each listing has its own site on the Airbnb platform, the programs were able to visit each page to obtain extensive information on the listing[1].

### 4. What useful information does it contain?

It is obvious that the data set contains various details of the rental rooms, host, license, reviews, and so on. Among these data, there are several very important information, such as the host_id, room_type, location, reviews, which are used on a wide scope for many further studies[1]. The host_id can help identify the page of each listing and the location help to identify the distribution of the Airbnb rental in the area. Meanwhile, the room type helps to see if the room was shared or not. And the reviews provide part of the number of visits to a listing. Except that, other data, such as availability and price, are also useful to check the future availability and the income analysis.

### 5. To what extent is the data 'complete'?

According to Murray, they have caught 95 percent of all listings in the cities for completeness, which can support additional research to some extent[1]. However, the dataset is dependent on third-party estimates of Airbnb activity, so it is subject to systematic mistakes[2]. Firstly, because the data set was limited in its gathering of book information, determining the amount of time for which residences are genuinely accessible or have been rented by guests is challenging[3]. This simply implies that there will be additional factors to examine when looking at the occupancy rate using visitor review data, and the conclusion related to these analyses need to be prudential and critical. Secondly, the latitude and longitude coordinates collected by Airbnb have been displaced by up to 150 meters in a random direction from the reallocation to help protect the privacy of the host[2]. So while undertaking a spatial analysis of city listings, it is important to keep in mind the randomness and uncertainty of these data and try to be more conservative. In addition, although there is information to check whether the room is shared, it is still difficult to clearly and specifically determine how many listings on Airbnb were being used to share spare housing capacity[3].

### 6. What kinds of analysis would this support?

Using these data can conduct in-depth discussions on the impact of Airbnb. These impacts include various aspects including housing, tourism, economy, urban management, and social differentiation. Many studies have been conducted utilizing this Inside Airbnb data to examine the link between Airbnb and the housing market, as well as its influence on the housing market. Dayne Lee examined the growth of Airbnb in Los Angeles, its impact on rents, and the total supply of affordable housing in the city, and proposed that Airbnb has displaced some Los Angeles residential areas, distorted the rental housing market that traditionally does not overlap with the hotel industry, and distorted the rental housing market[4]. In addition, this data set also reveals the influence of Airbnb on the traditional Hotel Industry. Airbnb's arrival into the market has a detrimental impact on hotel income, according to research, with cheap hotels and hotels that do not focus on business visitors being affected mostly[5]. Regarding the influence of Airbnb on social differentiation, many analyses have emphasized the phenomenon of gentrification. Research and analysis believe that Airbnb has generated a new type of rent gap by introducing a new potential investment flow into the property market. And gentrification caused on a wide scale has typically had a negative impact on communities[6].

### 7. Which of the uses presented in Q.6 are _ethical_?

With reference to the ethics of these analyses, it appears that more consideration is given to data privacy in data collection, as mentioned above in the random reallocation of host locations for privacy protection. In addition, another point of ethics is that how these analyses reflect or explain some of the ethical issues that have arisen during the development of Airbnb. One of the most notable issues is that of social differentiation. As mentioned above, the growth of Airbnb in communities can lead to the displacement of disadvantaged groups, which will lead to class differentiation and gentrification in the community[6]. Many studies in this area have further explored the impact of its development on different groups of people and have criticized the injustice concealed by Airbnb on an ethical level. For example, Benjamin Edelman and Michael Luca compiled images, price, and rental quality information from every landlord in New York City. They discovered that non-black landlords charged greater rates than black landlords under identical conditions and further pointed out that racial discrimination against landlords is a serious problem[7]. Furthermore, studies have shown that, while Airbnb claims to benefit the middle class by transferring revenue to limited and more diverse neighborhoods, listings in ethnically diverse areas are typically low-rated and low-income, despite the fact that these areas have higher levels of engagement and exchange rates than high-income areas[8]. It is also suggested that race is a crucial dynamic aspect that influences participation and communication patterns in the sharing economy, as well as education. It is clear from these studies that while Airbnb's data may appear to be just housing statistics, we can use it to better understand the processes of racialization, bordering, gendering, and other social disparities, as well as to promote social and economic justice.
